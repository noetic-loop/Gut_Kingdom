## _**Gut Kingdom – Episode 1**_

_“Time to ignite the flame of fermentation once again.”_

Inside the gut, tiny lives are working diligently today, as always.

As the fire of fermentation lights up the morning, a new day begins at the **Mucci Street Market.**

Welcome to a whimsical fantasy world set inside the human gut.

The sound of fermentation fills the air—

a quiet, steady hum that resonates only within a healthy gut.

This is the **Gut Kingdom.**

Soft light shines down at the entrance of Mucci Street Market.

Once again, the day begins.

“Alright, move along! Glucose kids, hop on board!”

With a lively voice, a small transport tray glides along the Main Tract inside the gut.

Riding on it are the sugars from breakfast—the cheerful Glucose kids.

“Yay! We’re in a warm rice porridge today!”

“And there’s a pickled plum — small, sour, and great for the gut!”

“Feels easier to digest than yesterday. So much better!”

Their tiny voices bubble with excitement as they are carried toward the villus line.

There, they will be greeted by digestive enzymes to fulfill their important mission—absorption.

Meanwhile, at a corner of the Mucci Street Market,

a poised figure stands before a steaming fermentation cauldron.

“Alright, let’s fire up the short-chain fatty acid line—activate!”

With a graceful motion, she stirs the ladle and inhales the steam deeply.

This is **Lacto,**

a leader of the Lactobacillus clan and supervisor of the fermentation operations.

Today, as always, fermentation begins under her command.

“Thanks to the contamination response team for yesterday. That was a close call.”

“Boss, the pH levels this morning are right on target! Holding at 6.5!”

Young fermentation bacteria gather around, bustling with energy,

working under Lacto’s strong yet caring presence.

At the immune control tower overlooking the scene,

a seasoned figure stands before an array of glowing monitors.

“Hmm… bowel movement forecast: 8:30 a.m.,

matching almost perfectly with yesterday… The host’s rhythm is remarkably steady.”

Murmuring to himself is **Lord Peyer,**

Commander of the gut kingdom’s immune system.

Diligently patrolling and monitoring, year-round, without rest.

“Hey, Boss Lacto, have you noticed?”

A voice calls out from the side alley near the fermentation district.

It’s **Captain Faeco**, leader of the opportunistic bacteria unit,

sporting his usual knitted beanie-like bacterial cap and sharp observational skills.

“…The host has been drinking more water lately.

Seems like they’ve gone back to umeboshi-kombucha.”

“I noticed. Fermentation flows smoother that way.

You can smell it—the acetic acid’s aroma gets so much lighter.”

Captain Faeco chuckles quietly, tickled by the fresh scent.

“It always smells great around you, Boss Lacto.”

“And,” he adds, lowering his voice,

“rumor has it… that ume-sho-bancha is back in action too.”

A flicker passes through Lacto’s gaze.

“A dark, salty brew made from fermented plum and roasted tea,”

—she murmurs, almost to herself.

“Strong enough to stir the kingdom’s balance.”

Captain Faeco salutes with a sly grin,

“Well, if the old remedies are making a comeback,

we might just survive this wave after all.”

Lacto smiles a little, and Captain Faeco heads off toward his patrol,

his knitted cap bobbing into the busy crowd.

It was a vibrant morning.

No one yet realized it was the beginning of a change.

Only Lord Peyer, frowning at a faintly strange pattern flickering across the monitors,

sensed that something was stirring.

_The flame has been lit._

_And the kingdom stirs, waiting for what is yet to come._

**Boss Lacto says:**

“…Hmph. Did the tale warm your core?”

She taps the rim of the cauldron gently with her ladle.

> “This kingdom runs on fire, guts, and a little kindness.

> If a bubble rose in your chest—or even a quiet ‘heh’ escaped your lips—

> you can now buy me a fermentation spark via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/ayarikkarowan) to help keep the fire burning.”

She smiles faintly.

“Every flicker keeps the fermentation alive. Thank you.”
